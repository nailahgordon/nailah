    <h1>Image One</h1>

    <img src="/nailah/image1.jpg" alt="First cropped image" width="800">

    <p>
      I chose this image of the beach where I used to live because it represents an important part of my life and identity. 
      It holds memories and emotions that helped shape who I am today. The beach symbolizes peace, freedom, and personal growth. 
      Even though I don’t live there anymore, it reminds me of where I come from and the experiences that influenced me.
